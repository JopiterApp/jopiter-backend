# Jopiter Backend

This project contains all the source code for Jopiter's backend. Every file is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later](LICENSE), unless stated otherwise.

## Infrastructure

The backend consists of services written using the [Kotless](https://github.com/jetbrains/kotless) framework and deployed to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). All services are written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and tested using [Kotest](https://github.com/kotest/kotest)

## Services

### Privacy

Contains Jopiter's Privacy Policy, generated by [App Privacy Policy Generator](https://app-privacy-policy-generator.firebaseapp.com/). It's a simple but mandatory boilerplate, although in general terms we don't keep users' data for anything.

Due to its simplicity, the Privacy service is not configured in its own module. The resource file is placed on the root project instead.
