# Jopiter Backend

This project contains all the source code for Jopiter's backend. Every file is released under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later](LICENSE), unless stated otherwise.

## Infrastructure

The backend consists of services written using the [Servlerless](https://www.serverless.com/) framework and deployed to [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). There's no preference for a single programming language, but each service tries to use the best tool for their responsibility.
